# ReactJs-Project
This is a React Js practice project where I will be going along a tutorial to help show me the ropes of using React.

# Why ReactJs
I thought that I would give it a try. When learning more about VueJs I would often hear about ReactJs, learning that React is more popular than Vue. This is great for someone wanting to get more involved in the tech industry since the demand for React Developers is high. So I'll be using a tutorial like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk&t=1030s&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh to give React a shot.
